After downloading these files, ensure they are placed in the correct directories before running the application.

### Running the Application

1. Start the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   cd model_folder
   python app.py
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the Streamlit frontend:
   ```bash
   # Activate the virtual environment again if needed
   cd <project-root>
   streamlit run frontend.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - Backend API: http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   - Frontend UI: http://localhost:8501/

## 🔌 API Endpoints

- 🔍 `POST /detect-walls-rooms`: Upload a floorplan image to detect rooms and walls
- 🏛️ `POST /generate-3d`: Generate a 3D model from a floorplan image
- 💰 `POST /estimate-construction-cost`: Calculate construction cost based on room data
- 🌎 `POST /update-location-type`: Update location type for cost estimation
- 📥 `GET /download-ply/<filename>`: Download a generated 3D model

## 📋 Usage

1. Upload a floorplan image through the Streamlit interface
2. View detected rooms and walls with visualization
3. Generate a 3D model of the floorplan
4. Modify parameters like location type to see different cost estimates
5. Download the 3D model for use in other applications

## ⚠️ Common Issues and Troubleshooting

- If the Flask server fails to start, ensure port 5000 is not in use by another application
- If room detection gives unexpected results, try using a clearer floorplan image
- For 3D model generation issues, ensure the floorplan has clear walls and room boundaries
- If you get errors about missing model files, check that you've downloaded the large files mentioned in the "Large File Downloads" section
